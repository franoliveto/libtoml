== microtoml

microtoml is a tiny TOML parser that uses only fixed-extent storage, and
is intended for use in constrained environments.

It is a plaything and a work in progress. It is not even yet compliant with
TOML v0.1.0.

To be built, it requires make, a C compiler, and asciidoctor to
format the documentation.

Building is straightforward. Simply, run:

```
make
```

To run the tests:

```
make test
```
